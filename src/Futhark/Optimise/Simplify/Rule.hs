-- | This module defines the concept of a simplification rule for
-- bindings.  The intent is that you pass some context (such as symbol
-- table) and a binding, and is given back a sequence of bindings that
-- compute the same result, but are "better" in some sense.
--
-- These rewrite rules are "local", in that they do not maintain any
-- state or look at the program as a whole.  Compare this to the
-- fusion algorithm in @Futhark.Optimise.Fusion.Fusion@, which must be implemented
-- as its own pass.
